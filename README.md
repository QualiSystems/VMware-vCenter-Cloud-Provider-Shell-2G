# Overview
A shell integrates a device model, application or other technology with CloudShell. A shell consists of a data model that defines how the device and its properties are modeled in CloudShell, along with automation that enables interaction with the device via CloudShell.

### Cloud Provider Shells
CloudShell Cloud Providers shells provide L2 or L3 connectivity between resources and/or Apps.

### VMware vCenter Cloud Provider Shell 2G
VMware vCenter Cloud Provider Shell 2G provides you with app deployment and management capabilities. 
These include the following:
* Python 3.7 support
* vSphere 7 support
* VM Customization Specifications
* Standard vSwitch connectivity
* Option to display the VM's web console directly from vCenter
* Capability to customize the VM's technical specs (storage size, memory, CPU), support for programmatically creating missing network interfaces if the VM is missing virtual network adapters
* Option to view cluster usage stats directly from the sandbox

For details, see the [Add VMware vCenter Cloud Provider Resource](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/vCenter-Cld-Prvdr-Rsc.htm) CloudShell Help article. For more information on the device, see the vendor's official product documentation.

### Standard version
VMware vCenter Cloud Provider Shell 2G is based on the Cloud Provider Standard version **1.1.0**.

# Importing and Configuring the Shell
This section describes how to import the VMware vCenter Cloud Provider Shell 2G shell and configure and modify the shell’s devices.

### Importing the shell into CloudShell

**To import the shell into CloudShell:**
  1. Make sure you have the shell’s zip package. If not, download the shell from the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page.
  
  2. In CloudShell Portal, as Global administrator, open the **Manage – Shells** page.
  
  3. Click **Import**.
  
  4. In the dialog box, navigate to the shell's zip package, select it and click **Open**. <br><br>The shell is displayed in the **Shells** page and can be used by domain administrators in all CloudShell domains to create new inventory resources, as explained in [Adding Inventory Resources](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/INVN/Add-Rsrc-Tmplt.htm?Highlight=adding%20inventory%20resources). 

### Offline installation of a shell

**Note:** Offline installation instructions are relevant only if CloudShell Execution Server has no access to PyPi. You can skip this section if your execution server has access to PyPi. For additional information, see the online help topic on offline dependencies.

In offline mode, import the shell into CloudShell and place any dependencies in the appropriate dependencies folder. The dependencies folder may differ, depending on the CloudShell version you are using:

* For CloudShell version 8.3 and above, see [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository).

* For CloudShell version 8.2, perform the appropriate procedure: [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository) or [Setting the Python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

* For CloudShell versions prior to 8.2, see [Setting the Python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

### Adding shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository
If your Quali Server and/or execution servers work offline, you will need to copy all required Python packages, including the out-of-the-box ones, to the PyPi Server's repository on the Quali Server computer (by default *C:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\Config\Pypi Server Repository*).

For more information, see [Configuring CloudShell to Execute Python Commands in Offline Mode](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=Configuring%20CloudShell%20to%20Execute%20Python%20Commands%20in%20Offline%20Mode).

**To add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository:**
  1. If you haven't created and configured the local PyPi Server repository to work with the execution server, perform the steps in [Add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository (offline mode)](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=offline%20dependencies#Add). 
  
  2. For each shell or script you add into CloudShell, do one of the following (from an online computer):
      * Connect to the Internet and download each dependency specified in the *requirements.txt* file with the following command: 
`pip download -r requirements.txt`. 
     The shell or script's requirements are downloaded as zip files.

      * In the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page, locate the shell and click the shell's **Download** link. In the page that is displayed, from the Downloads area, extract the dependencies package zip file.

3. Place these zip files in the local PyPi Server repository.
 
### Configuring a new resource
This section explains how to create a new resource from the shell.

In CloudShell, the component that models the device is called a resource. It is based on the shell that models the device and allows the CloudShell user and API to remotely control the device from CloudShell.

You can also modify existing resources, see [Managing Resources in the Inventory](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/INVN/Mng-Rsrc-in-Invnt.htm?Highlight=managing%20resources).

**To create a resource for the device:**  
  1. In the CloudShell Portal, in the **Inventory** dashboard, click **Add New**.
     ![Image][2]
     
  3. From the list, select **VMware vCenter Cloud Provider Shell 2G**.
  
  4. Click **Create**.
  
  5. In the **Resource** dialog box, enter the following attributes with data from step 1:

  |File name|Description|
  |:---|:---|
  |User|Paste here your vCenter User|
  |Password|Paste here your vCenter User Password|
  |Default Datacenter|Paste here default Datacenter|
  |Default dvSwitch|Paste here default dvSwitch which will be used for the connectivity|
  |Holding Network|Paste here default network that will be configured when disconnecting from another network|
  |VM Cluster|Paste here vCenter cluster or host that will be used when deploying a VM|
  |VM Storage|Paste here vCenter storage in which the VMs will be created|
  |VM Location|Paste here the full path to the folder within vCenter in which the VM will be created|
  
  6. Click **Continue**.

CloudShell validates provided settings and creates the new resource.

_**VMware vCenter Cloud Provider Shell 2G requires you to create an appropriate App template, which would be deployed as part of the sandbox reservation. For details, see the following CloudShell Help article: [Applications' Typical Workflow](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Apps.htm?Highlight=App#Adding)**_

# Updating Python Dependencies for Shells
This section explains how to update your Python dependencies folder. This is required when you upgrade a shell that uses new/updated dependencies. It applies to both online and offline dependencies.
### Updating offline Python dependencies
**To update offline Python dependencies:**
1. Download the latest Python dependencies package zip file locally.

2. Extract the zip file to the suitable offline package folder(s). 

3. Terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat). 

### Updating online Python dependencies
In online mode, the execution server automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate dependencies file to the online Python dependencies repository every time a new instance of the driver or script is created.

**To update online Python dependencies:**
* If there is a live instance of the shell's driver or script, terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat). If an instance does not exist, the execution server will download the Python dependencies the next time a command of the driver or script runs.

# Typical Workflows

## Connect vCenter Apps to an existing VLAN port group
Using the vCenter 2nd Gen shell, it is possible to connect an App or deployed App to an existing port group. This enables you to connect deployed Apps in different sandboxes and also to connect Apps deployed in a sandbox to static VMs on the vCenter server.

__Note__: This capability is supported only for vCenter Apps and applies to port groups created on the datacenter defined on the vCenter cloud provider resource.
For illustration purposes, the below procedure assumes you want to connect an App to port group "QS_vSwitch1_VLAN_100_Access".

__To connect an App to an existing port group:__
1. Download the _vCenter.VLAN.Port.Group.zip_ file from the vCenter 2G shell's Integrations [page](https://community.quali.com/repos/5386/vmware-vcenter-cloud-provider-shell-2g).
2. Import the ZIP file into CloudShell Portal.
3. Open the blueprint or sandbox. 
4. From the __App / Service__ pane, drag the new __vCenter VLAN Port Group__ service into the diagram.
5. Set the service's details:
   - __Port Group Name__: Full port group name. For example: "QS_vSwitch1_VLAN_100_Access".
   - __VLAN ID__: Port group's VLAN ID. For example: "100".
6. Click __Add__.
7. Create connection requirements between the vCenter Apps and the service.
8. Deploy the connection(s), as appropriate. 
9. <br>The connection is created like with any other VLAN service. This includes by deploying the App, connecting the purple Connector line if the App is already deployed, and reserving the blueprint.

# Workarounds

## **Rename HHD attribute to HDD** 

When using vCenter 2G Shell version 2.0.0 and 2.2.0, the App deployment types include an attribute that is incorrectly named "HHD" instead of "HDD". The below procedure explains how to fix this issue, which is done in CloudShell’s SQL Server’s _Quali_ database.
  ![Image][3]

__To rename the HHD attribute:__

1. On CloudShell’s SQL Server machine (usually hosted on the Quali Server machine), open SQL Server Management Studio.
![Image][4]

2. Connect to database.
<br>![Image][5]

3. Navigate to __Databases > Quali__. Right-click and select __New Query__.
![Image][6]

4. In the SQLQuery window, paste the following requests:

```
update AttributeInfo set Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From VM 2G.HDD' where (Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From VM 2G.HHD');
```

```
update AttributeInfo set Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From Template 2G.HDD' where (Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From Template 2G.HHD');
```

```
update AttributeInfo set Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From Image 2G.HDD' where (Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From Image 2G.HHD');
```

```
update AttributeInfo set Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From Linked Clone 2G.HDD' where (Name = 'VMware vCenter Cloud Provider 2G.vCenter VM From Linked Clone 2G.HHD');
```

   For example:
   <br>![Image][7]

5. Click __Execute__.
<br>The following output should be displayed:
![Image][8]

6. To verify, go to CloudShell Portal’s __Manage>Apps__ page. Open an App template that uses a vCenter 2G Shell resource. Make sure the vCenter 2G deployment types include the __HDD__ attribute:
